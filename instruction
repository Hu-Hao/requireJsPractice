Use RequireJS to load Underscore
to solve the following puzzle:
Use numbers from 1 to 9, no repeat
Find all the solutions that meets this requirement
AB X CDE = FGHI

for example
12 X 345 = 6789 is not ok
39 X 186 = 7254 is ok

Goal: learn how to use underscore functions
Take your time on this. It is not a speed test, but more like a training practice.

Algorithms analysis:
take all possible 4 digits number, search the rest five numbers permutations, see whether there is a combination
satisfy AB X CDE = FGHI
4 digits will have c(9,4) = 126 , so we have 126 collections.
each case will have 5! = 24 possible permutations(rest 5 digits);
time complexity should be around 120 *  126 = 15120
find 126 collections we need 9*8*7*6 + 9*8*7 + 9*8 + 9 = 3606
total = 18726
brute force (987-123) * (98 - 10) = 76032
